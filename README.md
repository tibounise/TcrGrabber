# TcrGrabber

### A bit of warning

Before using this script, be aware that this piece of shit... uh... software is not intended to be used illegally. So be carefull.

### What's this crap ?

It's a simple piece of software, intended to grab all the links of the MP3s of [The City Rises](http://thecityrises.com). The podcast ended last year, and I want to make a backup for my personnal use.

### How do I use it ?

```
python tcrgrabber.py
# And then
wget -i urls.txt
```
